### Description
<p>This project involves analyzing various aspects of a coffee shop's operations using PostgreSQL. The data used for this analysis includes sales records, staff working hours, and order details. The project focuses on answering business-related questions such as identifying top-selling items, understanding hourly sales trends, and evaluating employee working hours and costs.</p>

### Notes:
<p>The source of the database is Kaggle, but the tables have been significantly modified:</p>
<li> basic principles of normalisation were applied to bring them to normal forms;</li>
<li> PK and FK were added;</li>
<li> irrelevant columns and values were removed; </li>
<li> additional tables were created to display many-to-many relationships, etc.</li>
<p></p>
<p>The script of the corresponding current database was added.</p>
